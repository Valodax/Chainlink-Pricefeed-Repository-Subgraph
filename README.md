# Chainlink PriceFeed Subgraph

The following code is a Subgraph for The Graph's Decentralized Network. It allows individuals to get selected historical prices from the Ethereum Mainnet Chainlink Datafeeds in the PriceFeed Registry Contract: [0x47Fb2585D2C56Fe188D0E6ec628a38b74fCeeeDf](https://etherscan.io/address/0x47Fb2585D2C56Fe188D0E6ec628a38b74fCeeeDf).

It is recommended to query `DataFeeds` and then toggle the selected information parameters to see information relating to the pricefeed. 
From `DataFeeds`, select `prices` to see historical pricing information.
